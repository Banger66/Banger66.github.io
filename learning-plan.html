      <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>I would like to start out as a web dev - obviously! I really like the idea of working in the backend. Coming from an engineering background, I would love to dive into languages like C++, Python and JavaScript to do things like game development, app development and backend projects that i'm passionate about</p>
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h2>
        <p>I think that the best way for me to learn is to give me the tools, tell me what you want done, and let me do my best to do the job. I've been a student at the school of hard knocks pretty much my whole life, so trying and failing is a great way for me to learn. However, I'm not the greatest when someone walks me through all the steps on how to get the job done. I can't really get things stuck in my head unless I'm actively doing it, getting stuck and then asking question to get myself un-stuck</p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I try my best not to compare myself to others, but I guess it's something I've been struggling for a while, and I already have done that here when someone linked an awesome site they had made, I felt a bit stink. I really need to work on that. I do think I work well in a team however, I like to collaborate and come up with ideas and also ask questions to others who are more competent than myself.</p>
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
        <p>I am incredibly motivated to succeed in this industry. But that I don't mean that I'm out here to be the best developer in the world, but to be the best dev that I can be. I have a family to provide for, which means that I have to get the work done in a productive and safe manner. When things are starting to get to me, I find having a very short break - getting up and walking around while having a quick vape seems to help. If that doesn't work, usually talking to someone will.</p>
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>If i'm stuck on something, I'd have given it a go on my own for a couple minutes before consulting google for a fix. That usually works for me. If I'm still struggling after a few minutes of googling, then I definetely will go to ask someone about my issue, a learner or facilitator.</p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>Just to be there to tell us why things work and to be there when we get stuck</p>
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I take my kids to daycare at 8am and then pick them up at midday. Usually have lunch right after this so I can hit two birds with oine stone</p>
