      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        First of all, the fact that I can just let some of my negative emotions slide right past me. I used to get so hung up on feeling frustrated and it would kinda eat away at me for the rest of the day. Second, I found out that I can get so stoked about other people progressing and seeing people click on a problem that they get hugn up on. Lastly, I've learned that I really enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping people with something that I feel confident about. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Finding your priorities and what is most important to you is very important. You must find what values are worth defending, for me it's fairness and responsibility for learning and programming - being treated and treating others as an equal and owning up to mistakes. Empathy is necessary, having considerating for others, learning from successes and mistakes will only improve everyone. As goes for self awareness, realizing when to take breaks, when you're making mistakes and when you're overwhelmed by negative emotions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me it was knowing when to walk away from the computer when I get blocked and learning how to not get caught up in the rage and frustration when I just wasn't getting something.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Probably right at the start, getting myself in the mindset to accept the core learning. I didn't really see the point in the beginning, just wanted to get right into learning the technical skills. Now I can see why we learnt them, it was almost like learning to be able to learn.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think it's to get into the mindset not of trying to be a decent developer, but to be a decent person first. Being good at your job will only get you so far, if you're an absolutely bigoted asshole, no one will want to be around you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely not. Like I had just stated before, studying core material will make you a more attractive hire. If you're an empathatic person with a good ethic, that will take you much further not just in your career but also in life in general than someone who is just good at their job. I can recall last year when I worked on robots in Invercargill, the bloke I worked with was amazing, absolutely prestigious in his wealth of knowledge on the products, but no one in the company really wanted to spend any time with him. He would work 16 hours a day and barely took any time out for his family. Yes he was a great worker but it's all he devoted his entire life to. I really don't want to end up like him.
