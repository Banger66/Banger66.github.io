            In this current meta - as with all patches of Dota - Witch Doctor remains my number one favourite hero of all time. He may not be the best, have the highest win rate or pick rate, but he's just so damn fun to play, every time. He can easily be played in either a soft or hard support position, and I always I feel like i'm contributing to the team. Start out with regen for both yourself and your carry - the doc' can be a mana hungry hero for the first few levels. Put level 1 skill into the Bongo's and then you should choose Maledict for your second skill. Hit the enemy carry with the bongo's for a stun just long enough for you to get your Maledict on them, then ping the enemy so you and your carry can harrass them until they bite the dust. I always rush mana boots into Aether's - having that extra bit of cast range really helps the doc' stay out of trouble.
