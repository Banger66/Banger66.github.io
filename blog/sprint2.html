            In this sprint, we learned about the basics of HTML and CSS, what they are, what they mean and how to use them. I was already pretty familiar with them, as I had done a course through Udemy on the basics. It was a good place to start but it was 100% correspondance with just videos telling me what to do, much different to the Dev Academy. I'm still learning a lot of new things so hopefully this will all look a lot prettier in the coming weeks!
