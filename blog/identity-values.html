        <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h1>

        <p>Towards the end of 2020 we had a lot happening in my partners and I lives. We had bought our first house that year, got engaged and had our first daughter. Things at work were going okay, I was getting bored at my limitations
          of what my employer tasked me to do (just servicing machines, no new installs really happening) and grew hungry for a new challenge. I was approached by corporate to take over the franchise in Invercargill. Awesome! I thought.
          This is exactly what I had been hungry for. I would not just be servicing machines anymore, but also having to run a business and be responsible for looking after staff and keeping customers happy.</p>

        <p>When I approached my fiance about the move. She was very hesitant. We had our family up here for support which made family life a lot easier than it would be if we were to move somewhere where we knew nobody.</p>

        <p>This reflected some of my core values - Responsibility for providing for my family, Success in the form of achieving my goals for moving up in the world and opening a business, and Competency for knowing how the industry worked 
        and knowing to logistics for shifting our whole lives to the other end of the country.</p>

        <p>We eventually agreed to make the move, sold our house in Hamilton and found a beautiful home in Invercargill to start our new life.</p>

        <p>The first few months were great. Our family would come down and stay at our home, I was making friends related to my hobbies and work was going well. After a while though, my fiance grew depressed and unhappy, regretting the move.
        This caused cracks in our relationship as we both wanted different things and it became difficult at home. </p>

        <p>As things progressed, work got more stressful and I came to realize that I was way over my head, both from the perspective of running a business and being so far away from family and support. My fiance then decided that she couldn't
          take it anymore and she and our daughter moved back home to Hamilton. I had to make a decision. Stay down south and continue to run the business, which I worked so hard for, but also neglect my family and their needs?
        Or throw in the towel with work and come back to Hamilton and figure something else out in terms of work? It seems so obvious and clear now, but I had battled in my mind for so long to finally arrive, with contempt, to do the
          right thing and stay with my family and move back home.</p>

        <p>This made me realize about another core value that means so much to me now - compromise.</p>
