      <h2>A Time I Was Blocked On A Simple Problem</h2>
      <p>
        I was getting stuck on a challenge called FizzBuzz, where you are given a set of numbers, and every number that is a multiple of 3, 5 and 15 needs to be replaced with the words Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz, respectivly. I had laid out my psuedo code, so I knew what was necessary to acheive the goal, but wasn't too sure if the syntax was correct. Everything looked good to me so I ran the code. No way buddy, that didn't work. I knew it had to be something so simple that I missed so I took my time and went through the code referincing a JS cheat sheet to make sure I used the right commands. Maybe I shouldn't use the strictly equal operator, and just equal? Surely that'll do it. Feeling confident I ran the code again. Big error again. Now I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, because this should be pretty easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a deep breath, and started talking to my dig Frank about my code; my kinda version of the rubber ducky method. "Frank, this is my code. Look at it, it should work! If the number is divisible by 15, it returns FizzBuzz, you can see that in the curly braces. If the number is divisible by 5, it returns Buzz, you can see that in the curly braces. If the number is divisible by 3, it returns Fizz, you can see that in the curly braces. If the number isn't  divisible by any of those numbers, it just returns the number back. You can see that in the curly br-" I cut myself off to realise I used parenthesis instead of the curly braces. I quickly changed them and ran the code. It worked this time! Cheers Frank, you rule.

      <h2>
        Problem Solving Techniques
      </h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="psList">
           <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - Super helpful technique, write out what you want the code to do and then find the right methods and operators to get there. Then figure out all the syntax afterwards
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <strong>Trying Something</strong> - Yup, sometimes just stabbing in the dark can produce results that work, point you in the right direction, or at the very least, find something that doesn't quite work
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong> - Find yourself a nice inanimate object and talk your code through with it. This works really well for me, except I use my dog instead of a rubber duck
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - This is really important. If you can understand the feedback that the console is giving you, you can find out exactly where your problem lies
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <strong>Console.logging</strong> - So far I'm using this every time I write code to make sure all my methods and functions are giving me the results that I'm after
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <Strong>Googling</Strong> - Super obvious, yet super powerful. I have so many bookmarks and resources downloaded to help me find the correct solution to my syntax errors
        </li>
        <li class="psList">
          <strong>Asking for help</strong> - Definetely have had to resort to this a couple times when I got really super stuck. I think I have enough of an understanding and a good pool of resources to rely on asking too much, but i'm not afraid of asking if I really need to
        </li>
         <li class="psList">
            <strong>Improving process with reflection</strong> - This helps just sort of get negative emotions out of me by just riffing off on a tangent about whatever I'm feeling, and at the end of a sprint it's almost zenlike reflecting on what I've acheived
