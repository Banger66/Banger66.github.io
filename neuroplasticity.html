      <h2>
        Neuroplasticity
      </h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we understand that our brain is fully malleable, we can use this understanding to learn anything that we desire. The more we 
        engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brain will function at a higher level. When we learn something new, the
        chemicals in our brain change, influencing a short-term improvement or memory. If we stick at it and continue to practice, our
        neurons will change their connections and our brains structure. This will only happen if we commit more time and effort to the
        task. Finally, if we keep up the effort and time that goes into whatever we are learning, our brain networks will change accoringly.
        You can think of learning something like a road or highway. When you start to learn something, a new road is formed, leading to
        progressing that skill or function. Over time, if you force more and more vehicles to go to that skill or function, the road will
        need to become larger to support the flow of traffic. Eventually, that tiny little dirt road can end up being a multi lane 
        highway, allowing thousands and thousands of vehicles to reach their destination. This exact analogy can be used to describe 
        learning a new skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        To increase neuroplasticity, a few components are required. You must be challenged. Just like working out in a gym, no pain, no gain.
        You also need good intention. Maybe you want to learn a new language so that you can go visit the country of origin. If you attempt
        to learn something for no reason, you will really struggle to find the effort to put behind the learning. The learning must also
        require your attention. Focusing on the exact task will increase the likelihood of change. Repitition and intensity are also key.
        Going back to my gym analogy, you dont get a six pack from doing 30 situps once! Finally, time. You'll have to have some patience
        to achieve your goal and for neroplasticity to occur and change your brain.

        The following video was really good at helping me understand this topic:

      <h2>
        Growth Mindset
      </h2>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is a perspective of how we view intelligence and challenges. It is compared to a fixed mindset, which is a very
        static way of thinking, whereas a growth mindset understands that skills and intelligence can be developed on. People with a
        growth mindset are usually quite curious and embraces challenges and failures as a means to learn from them. They will focus on
        the process, not the end result, view intelligence and talent as dynamic and ever improving, and will be inspired by the success
        of others as opposed to being threatened by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I have always had somewhat of a growth mindset, I've always seen challenges and failures as an oppurtinty to learn much 
        from them as opposed to being disheartened by failure (although that does still happen rarely.)
        I definetely come from the school of hard knocks, always been one to pick myself up and dust myself off to give a challenge another
        crack. Case and point, last week doing the intro to JavaScript. There were times when things got a bit much for me and I was in
        over my head and didn't quite understand what was being shown or taught to me. But knew with more time and practice it would 
        eventually click, which is what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        This video is a really good explanation and a good analogy of growth mindset:
